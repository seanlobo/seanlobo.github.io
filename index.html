					<p>My name is Sean Lobo, and I'm an undergraduate studying Electrical Engineering and Computer
						Science at UC Berkeley. Ever since getting into Computer Science my senior year of High
						School, I've been completely hooked, and I love learning and applying new skills to solve
						novel problems - I'm currently most interested in Computational Biology, but I'm interested in exploring other areas such as Big Data, AI/ Machine Learning, and The Internet of Things</p>

							<h1>Computer Science</h1>
							<hr></hr>
							<p>My interest in Computer Science has steadily increased since my Senior
								Year of high school, and I'm currently facinated by the endless
								applications of it.</p>
							<p>Some notable periods are:</p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>June 2014 - August 2014: Interned at Computatation Biology company
										(JCVI) and got hooked to CS</li>
									<li>August 2015 - Present: Started at UC Berkeley, since then I've been competely blown away by the subject and can't seem to get enough
								</ul>
							</p>

						<div class="chart-text hide" data-chart="1">
							<h1>Biology</h1>
							<hr></hr>
							<p>I've been intersted in Biology ever since middle school, and for a while
								I thought I would end up majoring in it. That changed when I found out about
								Computer Science, but I'm still extremely intersted in biology and applications in the field.</p>
							<p>Some notable periods are:</p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>August 2012: Enrolled in AP Biology, and learned much more about the field</li>
									<li>September 2013: Started coaching the Science Olympiad event 'Designer Genes' at my high school</li>
									<li>June 2014 - August 2014: Started to shift my focus to Computer Science, but maintained an interest in the field</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

						<div class="chart-text hide" data-chart="2">
							<h1>Smash</h1>
							<hr></hr>
							<p>I got into Super Smash Bros (Melee) near the end of high school, and I continue to play the game. I currently occupy the unique purgatory of being too good for casual play yet not good enough for competetive games.</p>
							<p>Some notable periods are:</p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>June 2014: Played in a high school tournament during the end of classes and got interestd in playing more</li>
									<li>January 2015 - May 2015: Started playing more and more with friends after finishing college apps</li>
									<li>February 2016 - Present: Got a setup in my college dorm and start to level up</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<h1>Anime</h1>
							<hr></hr>
							<p>I never thought I'd get into anime, but lo and behold just like almost everyone else I did</p>
							<p>Some notable periods are:</p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>February 2014: Watched my first show (Attack on Titan) and got interested</li>
									<li>June 2014: Started a fulltime internship at JCVI and stabilized in interest</li>
									<li>January 2015 - March 2015: One Piece</li>
